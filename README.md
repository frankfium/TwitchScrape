# TwitchScrape
## A scalable Twitch.tv data collection program
---
## Dependencies and Usage
- Selenium python
  - pip install selenium
- datetime python
  - pip install datetime
- json
### The Problem
- Twitch tends to hide underlying data under JS load functions
- restricts scraping capapbilities
### The Goal
- Collect a set number of Twitch catagories
  - Collect catagory viewer count
- Collect streamer details in catagories
  - Return streamer names
  - Return viewer count
- Return this info in graphable elements to see which streamers <br/>
have the mose impact on a catagory
### WIP
- This is still a work in progress
  - I plan on creating a web-based application to stylize this data
